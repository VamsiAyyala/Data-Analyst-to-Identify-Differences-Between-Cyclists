Business Objectives:
The company cyclist has two types of consumers which are casual riders and subscribed members. Recently, executives at the company have identified that subscribed members generate more revenue for the company than casual riders and want to find the best incentive to convert casual riders into subscribed members. They acknowledge that the best way to approach this problem is by first identifying the differences between casual riders and subscribed members using product usage data and then using these differences to generate member conversion incentives.

Primary stakeholders:
1. Director of Marketing
2. My manager Lily Moreno
   
Deliverable:
1. To analyze data from several months of bicycle use from both members and casual riders throughout the year and take note of their differences.
2. Identify what these differences are and how they can be  used to create an effective marketing regime geared towards convincing  casual riders to sign up for an annual membership

Conclusion/Recommendations:
The amount of distance traveled by the casual rider is higher than that of a member while the amount of time spent by the casual rider over members is higher. Casual riders seem to use their bicycles less frequently than regular members and spend significantly more of their time riding on Mondays than members.
One way to address this marketing trend is to offer discounts for riders who spend less than two days a week riding and offer different payment options depending on the frequency of days a rider chooses to cycle.  For example, the lowest payment offer could be offered to riders who ride less than only once a week, medium to riders who ride 2-3 days, and the highest payment option to riders who ride more than three days.
Offer a discount to new members that varies per season.  The highest in the winter(the greatest difference in cycle use between members and the lowest in the summer(the lowest difference in cycle use between members).
Offer an additional discount to new members who ride their bicycles for more than 30 minutes at a time, an activity that casual members have a preference for. This will push greater incentives towards joining as a new member as casual members tend to ride for longer periods than traditional members.
